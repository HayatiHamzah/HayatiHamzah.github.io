## tl;dr
In order to identify the brand of handbags, a deep neural network was built to recognize images with a precision of 97% and recall of 96% while explaining the techniques used throughout the process.

## Problem Statement
Machine learning are one of essential data science tools for businesses to understand their content and how their users/consumer interact with it. These efforts have mainly focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) where we have created tools that can automatically detect topics, entities (e.g., people, organizations, products), and keywords in an article published by any of our brands. This information serves as useful building blocks for other tools to improve both the user and editorial experience.

In addition to textual content, our stories include vibrant videos and images. These graphical media provide exciting frontiers where we can utilize and Machine Learning to enhance our experiences.

After considering different components of a data product, this projects intned to create a prototype handbag brand classifier. We decided to focus on handbags because they are objects from the fashion domain, where Condé Nast already has a significant presence. Furthermore, from a computer vision perspective, handbags are rather complex objects. Many brands have features that distinguish them visually. These features range from the more obvious (e.g., patterns, logos) to the less visible (e.g., textures, pockets, latches, straps). Indeed, a “human expert” can make a reasonably good prediction of the handbag's brand without having seen that exact model.
