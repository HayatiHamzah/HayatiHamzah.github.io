## About me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

Hello, I am Hayati from tropical Singapore. 

I am a graduate from NUS Engineering School where I majored in Environmental Engineering. You could say that I do have a rather technical background as I am familiar with AutoCad and MicroStation. After a few work assignments in Environmental Engineering Company and, a Quantity Surveying and Project Management Company for a year, I pursued my interest in Data analytics and Statistics in June 2017. 

My first experience with programming was Fortran, which I had to learn for one of my Civil Engineering classes. Learning the fundamental of writing a 'for-loop' and defining variable gave me such a rush that I could never shake off. The first 'mini' project I wrote with Fortran was a 'BMI (Body-mass index)' calculator.

Continued my programming interest after my graduation with Udemy Complete Python Bootcamp:From Zero to Hero by Jose Portialla. Apart from the online course, I am an avid reader of Data Science websites such as KDNugget, DataScienceCentral and others. Eventually, I decided to enrolled into General Assembly Data Science Immersive from November 2017 to February 2018.

On social media, we may share our own thoughts and advance our image notwithstanding spreading musings for different associations and affiliations. With such a critical number of associations with people and relationship on social media, our experience can be over-burden with a considerable measure of information.

## Backstory
In my last semester in NUS, I found myself rather disconnected with the work I was invovled with.
