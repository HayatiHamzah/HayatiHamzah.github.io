## About me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

Hello, I am Hayati from tropical Singapore. 

I am a graduate from NUS Engineering School where I majored in Environmental Engineering. You could say that I do have a rather technical background as I am familiar with AutoCad and MicroStation. After a few work assignments in Environmental Engineering Company and, a Quantity Surveying and Project Management Company for a year, I pursued my interest in Data analytics and Statistics in June 2017. 

My first experience with programming was Fortran, which I had to learn for one of my Civil Engineering classes. Learning the fundamental of writing a 'for-loop' and defining variable gave me such a rush that I could never shake off. The first 'mini' project I wrote with Fortran was a 'BMI (Body-mass index)' calculator.

Continued my programming interest after my graduation with Udemy Complete Python Bootcamp:From Zero to Hero by Jose Portialla. Apart from the online course, I am an avid reader of Data Science websites such as KDNugget, DataScienceCentral and others. Eventually, I decided to enrolled into General Assembly Data Science Immersive from November 2017 to February 2018.
### Purpose of the website
<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
<ol>
  <li>Data Science fans can watch this space to learn about simple ways to create value from their data</li>
  <li>Beginners are able to understand how to create data products such as image classifiers</li>
</ol> </div>
This blog has something for everyone who is a stranger to data science. Those who beginner data wranglers, the all the projects posted apart from the capstone will provide you with crucial tips and tricks. This tricks are will give you a guide on what to look out for when munging your dataset. Maybe even change the world with one line of code at a time. 


### Area of Interest
<div class="box">
  <p>
    Understanding how people work and think is a key interest of mine. By mining for data and conducting statistical analysis on a pool of data on a particular group. We are able to learn how they interact with each other, their preference and habits as a group. From these insights, we are able to plan strategies and create data-driven products to better serve them.

On social media, people tend to share their personal thoughts and advance our image notwithstanding spreading musings for different associations and affiliations. With such a critical number of associations with people and relationship on social media, our experience can be over-burden with a considerable measure of information. However, using powerful tools such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, we are visualise this data and put them into actionable insights.

## Backstory
In my last semester in NUS, I found myself rather disconnected with the work I was involved with. The fascinating work of environmental engineering has been able to open my mind to optimising workflow and resources. Yet, this was a disconnect between the work I did and understanding the intrinsic needs of others. 

I was always fascinated by recommender systems. It's a huge part of my life. From making online purchaese on Asos to suggesting a great movie on Netflix, recommender systems have been able to exposed me to a new and excitings despite a busy schedule.
